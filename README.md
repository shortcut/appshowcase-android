# App Showcase

App Showcase is an interactive internal tool where we display all our apps/projects Shortcut either works on or has worked on. It is meant to be a tool to give an overview of what Shortcut has done and what we have achieved.
It is built as a native Android app, and is best paired with a vertical screen such as the Samsung 43" The Sero 4K QLED smart-TV QE43LS05TAUXXC.

### Built with

* Compose UI
* RoomDB
* Hilt
* Bunch of accompanist stuff

### Contributing

There is a dedicated Firebase back-end for this project, called Showcase backend. It follows similar functionality to the ReviewManager backend, where data is scraped, formatted and stored in a DB.
